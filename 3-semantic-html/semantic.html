                   <blockquote>
                        1.- Life is not fair, get used to it.
                        <br>
                        2.- The world does not care about your self-esteem, the world will wait for you to achieve 
                        something, before you feel good about yourself.
                        <br>
                        3.- You will not earn 4,000 dollars a month just after leaving the university and you will not be 
                        vice president until that with your effort you have earned both.
                        <br>  
                        4.- If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you have a boss. That yes that will not have
                        vocation of teaching nor the patience required.
                        <br>
                        5.- Dedicating yourself to frying hamburgers does not take away your dignity. Your grandparents had
                        a different word to describe it: what they called opportunity.
                        <br>
                        6.- If you screw up, it is not your parents' fault, so do not regret your mistakes, learn from them. 
                        <br>
                        7.- Before you were born, your parents were not as boring as they are now. They became so by paying your 
                        bills, cleaning your clothes, and listening to you talk about your problems. So start the journey by 
                        cleaning things up in your own life, starting with your room. 
                        <br>
                        8.- In school, the difference between winners and losers may have been eliminated, but in real life, no. In
                        some schools they no longer miss school years and they give you the answers to solve an exam and less and less
                        responsibilities. That has nothing to do with real life. 
                        <br>
                        9.- Life is not divided into semesters. You won't have long summer vacations in faraway places, and very 
                        few bosses will be interested in helping you find yourself. You will have to do all this in your free time. 
                        <br>
                        10.- Television is not daily life. In everyday life, people really have to get out of the movie cafe to go to work.
                        <br>
                        11.- Be nice to the 'nerds'. Chances are good that you will end up working for one of them.
